# navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition
  ( (position) => {
          const { latitude, longitude } = position.coords;
          setLocation({ lat: latitude, lon: longitude });
        }, what is(position) doing here?



ANS> In the navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition function, position is an object passed as an argument to the callback function when the browser successfully retrieves the user's current location. This position object contains information about the user's geographical location.

# Breakdown of position:
1. getCurrentPosition:

This method is part of the Geolocation API and is used to get the current geographic position of the device.
It takes up to three arguments:
A success callback function (which is called when the location is successfully retrieved).
An optional error callback function (which is called if thereâ€™s an error retrieving the location).
An optional options object to specify settings like timeout.

2. Success Callback Function:

The first argument of `getCurrentPosition` is the success callback function, which is called with a position object if the location retrieval is successful.
3. position Object:

This object contains details about the location. The most important property within position is coords.

4. coords:

position.coords is an object that contains the geographic coordinates and other location-related data.
Key properties in coords include:
latitude: The latitude of the device in degrees.
longitude: The longitude of the device in degrees.
accuracy: The accuracy level of the latitude and longitude in meters.
